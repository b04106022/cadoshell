			<h2>Avo's Tech News</h2>
		
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more chatbots have popped out on Facebook, LINE, or some other websites these days, giving online 
			users recommendations or advices for foods, trips, and sometimes even health problems.&nbsp; Some chatbots also provide customer services and 
			collect their opinions meanwhile.&nbsp; What’s behind the chatbots is the so-called <a class="CAI">Conversational AI Platform Technology</a>, 
			which has gathered both linguistics and computational scientists together to work hard over the past few years.</p><br>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounding distant, though, Conversational AI platform technology is actually developed with the intention 
			that users can use a variety of natural languages, such as voice, text, or gesture etc., to interact and communicate with the device or 
			application.&nbsp; And all kinds of online chat boxes have been widely adopted by enterprises to provide customers with online services 
			or as a customer survey tool.</p><br>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s assumed that by the year of 2020, most of the relationships between customers and enterprises will be preferred not to built 
			on the interaction with humans.&nbsp; That’s probably when chatbots start to take over the customer-service stuff;
			<i> by the time, humans no longer need to tolerate other humans</i>.&nbsp; However, improving the ways how chatbots understand users’ need 
			and how they answer remains the main topic in this field.&nbsp; With human intervention, say users’ or developers’ touch or other feedbacks, 
			it can speed up the process of machine learning and help a lot to increase the degree of accuracy with which the chatbots act more natural 
			and humanlike.</p><br>
